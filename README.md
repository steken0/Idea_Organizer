## Note:  

Running this project with an emulator is not advised, although possible. Some functionallity, like the ability record audio, is limited, if even possible at all. This is due to the way emulators are designed.

This app is designed specificly for phones. Tablet support might be limited.

This guide requires you to have Android Studio installed. (Use recommended settings if uncertain) Link: https://developer.android.com/studio

1. Open up android studio and go to: File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git. Follow the instructions and paste the GitHub link.

(Alternatively download the project and go to Files -> Open an existing Android Studio project. Select the root folder.

2. Wait for it to load. Even when loaded into android studio, it might take a minute or 2 for it to sync with the gralde files. If it doesnt load by itself, try going to file -> sync project with gradle files (If this option is not clickable, it's still loading).

Select Android App template, In the option Module, select 'Test14.app' and save the configuration. If 'Test14.app' doesn't show up here, see step 2.
